# zolra (né zola (né Gutenberg))

Viv's personal modifications to zola, a fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

# Modifications

- Allow tags to be specified at the root level in front matter, for compatibility with Obsidian
- Maybe more? not yet!

# Docs

Documentation is available on [its site](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) or
in the `docs/content` folder of the repository and the community can use [its forum](https://zola.discourse.group).

This tool and the template engine it is using were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of 
Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.
